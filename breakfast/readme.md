# Chocolate Chia Seed Pudding

## Servings: 
  3 tasty servings!

## Time to prepare: 
- Prep Time: 10 minutes
- Refrigerate Time: 3-4 hours

## Ingredients:
-   1 cup unsweetened plant-based milk
-   6 tablespoons chia seeds
-   1/4 cup maple syrup, honey or sweetener of choice
-   2 tablespoons cocoa powder
-   1/8 teaspoon salt
-   1 teaspoon vanilla extract
-   berries, chocolate, nuts for topping

## Equipment needed: 
-   High power blender
-   Spatula
-   Resealable container (plastic or glass)

## Steps for preparation:

1. Add almond milk, chia seeds, maple syrup, cocoa powder, vanilla and salt into a high powered blender
2. Start at a low setting on your blender (variable on the Vitamix) and progress to high
3. Blend until chia seeds are almost undetectable and mixture is smooth, scraping down the sides of the blender with a spatula if needed
4. Top with your favorite toppings and dive in or if you like your chocolate pudding cold, transfer to a resealable container, cover and refrigerate for 3-4 hours to chill before eating.

### Notes:
If you do not blend the chia seeds it will have a less smooth and creamy texture, more similar to regular chia seed pudding.

You can also use stevia, honey, or monkfruit sweetener as alternatives to maple syrup.
